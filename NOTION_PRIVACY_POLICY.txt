LIFEBLOCK PRIVACY POLICY

Last updated: January 2026

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SUMMARY

Your data stays on your device. We don't collect, sell, or share anything. Period.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE COLLECT

Nothing. All your habit data, check-ins, streaks, and settings are stored locally on your iPhone. We have no servers. We can't see your data even if we wanted to.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DATA STORAGE

• Local Storage: All data is stored on your device using Apple's secure systems
• iCloud Sync: If enabled, your data syncs through YOUR personal iCloud account - we never access it
• HealthKit: We read exercise and sleep data (with your permission) to auto-fill check-ins. This data never leaves your device.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THIRD PARTIES

• Apple App Store: Handles all payments. We never see your credit card or payment info.
• Apple Push Notifications: Used for daily reminders. Managed entirely by Apple.

That's it. No analytics companies. No ad networks. No data brokers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR RIGHTS

• Access: All your data is visible in the app
• Export: Premium users can export all data as JSON
• Delete: Uninstall the app to delete all local data. For iCloud data, go to Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Storage

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

LifeBlocks does not knowingly collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CHANGES

We may update this policy. Check back occasionally.
