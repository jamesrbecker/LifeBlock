## Priority 4: Launch Day Posts

**Post 1 - Launch Announcement (Pin this)**
```
I built an app.

LifeBlocks - your daily accomplice for building the life you want.

• Choose your path (16 life archetypes)
• Track habits in 30 seconds
• Watch your year turn green

It's like GitHub contributions, but for your life.

Free on the App Store 🟩

[App Store Link]
```

**Post 2 - The Why**
```
Why I built LifeBlocks:

I was tired of habit apps that felt like chores.

Complex logging. Guilt trips. Overwhelming features.

So I made something simple:

1. Pick your life path
2. Swipe through habits daily
3. Watch your grid fill up

30 seconds. That's it.
```

**Post 3 - Show the Grid**
```
Your year, visualized.

Every green block = a day you showed up.

LifeBlocks turns your habits into a contribution grid.

Simple. Visual. Satisfying.

```

**Post 4 - Path Selection**
```
16 life paths. One app.

• Content Creator
• Entrepreneur
• Software Engineer
• Fitness
• Student
• Investor
• Health & Wellness
• Parent
• + 8 more

Each path comes with curated habits for YOUR goals.

Which path are you on?
```

**Post 5 - Thread: Building in Public**
```
How I built LifeBlocks (thread) 🧵

1/ Started with a simple idea: What if tracking habits felt as satisfying as filling a GitHub contribution graph?

2/ The problem with most habit apps: They're either too simple (boring) or too complex (overwhelming).

3/ The solution: Life paths. Instead of building habits from scratch, choose your archetype and get a curated starter pack.

4/ 16 paths total: Creator, Entrepreneur, Engineer, Athlete, Student, Parent, Investor, Health, Fitness, Musician, Actor, Doctor, Game Dev, Writer, Creative, Digital Nomad.

5/ Track in 30 seconds. Swipe cards. Done, partial, or skip. No journals. No elaborate tracking.

6/ Watch your grid turn green over time. Visual progress > streaks alone.

7/ Privacy first. All data stays on your device. No accounts. No tracking.

8/ Now live on the App Store. Free to download.

Title: I made a habit tracker that visualizes your year like a GitHub contribution graph

Hey r/productivity,

I built LifeBlocks because I wanted a habit tracker that:
- Takes less than 30 seconds to use daily
- Shows visual progress (not just streaks)
- Doesn't guilt trip you for missing days

The core idea: Choose a "life path" (like Student, Entrepreneur, Fitness, etc.) and get curated habits for that goal. Track daily with simple swipe cards. Watch your year fill up with green blocks.

It's like GitHub contributions, but for your actual life.

Free on iOS. No account required. All data stays on your device.

Would love feedback from this community!

Title: [Method] Visual habit tracking that actually motivates me

I've tried dozens of habit apps. Most either overwhelmed me with features or bored me with basic checklists.

What finally worked: treating my habits like code contributions.

Built an app called LifeBlocks that shows your year as a grid. Every day you check in, it fills a block. Over time, you see your consistency (or lack of it) at a glance.

The visual feedback loop is surprisingly motivating. Way more than streaks alone.

Free on iOS if anyone wants to try it.

- 30-second daily check-ins
- Apple Health integration
- Home screen widgets
- Privacy-focused (all data on-device)

Free with optional premium for unlimited habits.

Feedback welcome!

### LinkedIn Post

```
Excited to share something I've been building: LifeBlocks 🟩

It's a habit tracking app with a twist - your progress shows up as a visual grid, like GitHub contributions but for your daily life.

The insight that drove this: Most habit apps fail because they're either too complex (you stop using them) or too simple (they don't motivate you).

LifeBlocks solves this with "life paths" - choose your archetype (Entrepreneur, Engineer, Creator, Student, etc.) and get a curated set of habits designed for that journey.

Track in 30 seconds. Watch your year turn green.

Now live on the App Store. Free to download.

If you're into productivity tools or building habits, I'd love your feedback.
