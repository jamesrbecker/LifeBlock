**Post 1 - Professional Angle**

I built an app to solve my own problem.

I wanted to be more consistent with my daily habits. But every app felt like a chore—complex dashboards, too many features, guilt-tripping notifications.

So I built LifeBlocks.

The idea is simple:
• Choose your life path (entrepreneur, engineer, creator, etc.)
• Get curated habits that actually matter for your goals
• Check in daily in 30 seconds
• See your effort as a visual grid—like GitHub contributions

Every green square is a day you showed up for yourself.

It's free on the App Store. Would love feedback from this community.

Title: I built a habit tracker that shows your year as a GitHub contribution grid

Hey r/productivity,

Longtime lurker, first time poster about my own project.

I've tried every habit tracker out there—Streaks, Habitica, Notion templates, you name it. None stuck.

What I really wanted was:
1. Something visual that showed my entire year at a glance
2. A simple daily check-in (not 10 minutes of logging)
3. Habits that actually matched my goals

So I built LifeBlocks.

Key features:
- Choose a "life path" (entrepreneur, software engineer, content creator, etc.) and get curated habits
- Daily check-in takes 30 seconds—swipe cards for each habit
- Your progress shows as a GitHub-style grid
- Free tier is actually useful (5 habits, full tracking)

Privacy-focused: all data stays on your device.

Just launched on the App Store. Would love honest feedback.

Title: Visualizing my habits as a grid changed everything for me

There's something powerful about seeing your entire year as colored squares.

Empty squares = days I didn't show up
Green squares = days I did

No complex analytics. No guilt trips. Just a visual record of consistency.

I built an app around this concept called LifeBlocks. It's basically GitHub contributions for your life.

The best part: you choose your "path" (what you're trying to become—entrepreneur, creator, engineer, etc.) and it suggests habits that actually matter for that goal.

Free on the App Store if anyone wants to try it.
