### Launch Tweets

**Tweet 1 - Hook**
```
I built a habit tracker that shows your life as a visual grid.

Every day you check in, your grid fills with green.

Miss a day? You'll see it.

It's addictively simple.

LifeBlocks - now on the App Store.
```

**Tweet 2 - Visual Focus**
```
Your year. One glance.

LifeBlocks turns your daily habits into a beautiful grid.

Green = you showed up
Empty = you didn't

No complex stats. No overwhelming features.

Just visual proof that you're becoming who you want to be.
```

**Tweet 3 - Pain Point**
```
Most habit apps fail because they're too complicated.

LifeBlocks asks you ONE question per habit:
"Did you do it today?"

Yes / Partially / No

That's it. Your grid fills up. You see your progress.

Simple beats complex every time.
```

**Tweet 4 - FOMO/Streak**
```
Day 47 of my streak.

The thought of breaking that green chain keeps me going more than any motivational quote ever could.

Sometimes accountability is just... visual.
```

**Tweet 5 - Thread Starter**
```
I've tried every habit app.

Too gamified.
Too limited.
Too complex.
No visual progress.

Then I built what I actually wanted:

A visual grid for your life.

Here's why it works: 🧵

## Threads Posts

### Thread 1
```
Unpopular opinion: Most habit trackers fail because they try to do too much.

LifeBlocks does one thing:
Shows you a grid of your year.

Green = you did the thing
Gray = you didn't

That's it. That's the app.

And somehow that visual simplicity is more motivating than any complex analytics dashboard.
```

### Thread 2
```
The psychology behind LifeBlocks:

1. Loss aversion - You don't want to break your streak
2. Visual progress - Your brain loves seeing patterns fill in
3. Simplicity - Less friction = more consistency

Sometimes the best UX is just... less.
```

### Thread 3
```
Building habits is hard.
Tracking them shouldn't be.

LifeBlocks:
- 30 seconds to check in
- One glance to see your year
- Zero overwhelm

Available now on iOS.
```
