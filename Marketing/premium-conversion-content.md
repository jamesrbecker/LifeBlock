**Subject:** Your first square awaits

```
Hey [Name],

Welcome to LifeBlocks.

You just took the first step toward visual accountability.

Here's how to make the most of your first week:

1. Add 1-2 habits you want to track
2. Check in every day (it takes 30 seconds)
3. Watch your grid start to fill

That's it. No complex setup. No overwhelming features.

Just show up, and your grid will prove it.

Your first green square is waiting.

— The LifeBlocks Team

P.S. Reply to this email if you have any questions. We read everything.
```

### Email 2: First Streak (Day 3)
**Subject:** 3 days. You're doing it.

```
[Name],

You've checked in 3 days in a row.

Most people quit apps by day 2. You didn't.

Look at your grid. See those green squares? That's proof.

Keep going. Day 7 hits different.

— LifeBlocks
```

### Email 3: Premium Nudge (Day 7)

### Email 4: Social Proof (Day 14)
**Subject:** What 30 days looks like

```
[Name],

Imagine opening your app and seeing this:

[Image: Full month of green squares]

That's what our Premium members see after one month.

They're tracking 5-10 habits across their entire life:
- Morning routine
- Workouts
- Reading
- Meditation
- Sleep quality
- Hydration
- Learning
- Relationships

All in one beautiful grid.

You're already tracking [X] habits. Why stop there?

```

### Email 5: FOMO/Urgency (Day 21)
**Subject:** Your streak deserves more

```
[Name],

You're on a [X]-day streak.

That's incredible. But here's the thing:

You're only seeing part of the picture.

With just 2 habits, you're missing out on tracking:
- Your workouts (auto-synced from Apple Health)
- Your sleep quality
- Your reading habit
- Your meditation practice
- Whatever matters to you

Premium members see their ENTIRE life in one grid.

Same effort. 5x the insight.

## Pricing Psychology Copy

### Annual vs Monthly
```
Monthly: $4.99/month
Annual: $29.99/year (save 50%)

"That's less than one coffee per month for a year of accountability."
```

### Value Comparison
```
LifeBlocks Premium: $29.99/year

vs.

Gym membership you don't use: $600/year
Self-help books you don't finish: $200/year
Therapy (valuable, but): $2,400/year

Invest $30 in actually building the habits that change your life.

If you're not seeing more green squares after a week, it's not for you.

But you will.
```

## Objection Handling

### "I only need 2 habits"
```
That's how it starts. But once you feel the power of visual accountability, you'll want it for everything.

Morning routine. Workouts. Reading. Hydration. Sleep.

Premium is there when you're ready to expand.
```

### "It's too expensive"
```
$2.50/month.

Less than a coffee.

For an entire year of accountability, streak tracking, and visual proof that you're becoming who you want to be.

What's that worth to you?
```

### "I'll upgrade later"
```
The best time to upgrade is when you have momentum.

You're on a [X]-day streak. Your habits are forming.

Don't let the 2-habit limit hold you back now.
```

### "Free apps exist"
```
Free apps make money from your attention (ads) or your data.

We make money from a simple subscription because we want you to succeed, not scroll.

Your focus is the product. Protect it.
```
