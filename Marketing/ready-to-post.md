## TWITTER/X - Ready to Post

### Post 1
```
I built a habit tracker that shows your life as a visual grid.

Green = you showed up
Empty = you didn't

No complex analytics. No overwhelming features. Just visual proof you're building the life you want.

LifeBlocks - free on the App Store.
```

### Post 2
```
Day 1: "I should probably track my habits"
Day 7: "Okay this streak thing is addictive"
Day 30: "I literally cannot let this grid have a gray square"

The psychology of visual accountability is undefeated.
```

### Post 3
```
Most habit apps fail because they're designed by people who love complexity.

LifeBlocks asks one question:
"Did you do it today?"

Yes. Partial. No.

That's it. Your grid fills. You see your year.

Simple > Complex. Every time.
```

### Post 4
```
Things I track in LifeBlocks:

• Gym
• Reading
• No phone before 9am
• 8 hours sleep
• Meditation

One grid. One glance. Entire year.

Visual accountability hits different.
```

### Post 5
```
The best productivity system is the one you actually use.

After trying 10+ habit apps that were all too complex...

I needed something stupidly simple.

So I built it.

LifeBlocks. Just a grid. Just your habits.
```

### Post 6 (Thread)
```
How to actually build habits that stick:

1/ Make tracking effortless (30 seconds or less)

2/ Create visual proof of progress (your brain craves patterns)

3/ Fear loss more than desire gain (streaks work because breaking them hurts)

4/ Remove all friction (one tap, done)

That's why I built LifeBlocks.

A visual grid for your life. Watch it fill up. Try not to break it.

Simple psychology. Real results.
```

### Caption 1 (Grid Screenshot)
```
Your year. One glance.

Every green square = a day you showed up for yourself.

LifeBlocks makes habit tracking visual, simple, and addictive.

No complex features. No overwhelming analytics.

Just proof that you're doing the work.

```

### Caption 2 (Before/After or Progress)
```
3 months of showing up.

Not perfect. But consistent.

That's what LifeBlocks taught me - progress over perfection.

Some days are partial. Some days I miss. But the grid doesn't lie.

And seeing that visual proof keeps me going more than any motivational quote.

### Caption 3 (Lifestyle/Morning Routine)
```
My morning starts with this.

Open LifeBlocks. See my streak. Check in.

30 seconds. Done.

The rest of the day, that green square is waiting for me.

It's simple accountability that actually works.

#morningroutine #habits #productivity #dailyhabits #consistency
```

### Caption 4 (Premium Push)
```
Free: 2 habits
Premium: Unlimited habits, widgets, auto-tracking from Apple Health

I started free. Got addicted to the grid. Upgraded.

Now I track everything:
✓ Workouts
✓ Reading
✓ Sleep
✓ Meditation
✓ Hydration
✓ No social before noon

One grid. Complete picture.

Worth every penny.

## THREADS - Ready to Post

### Post 1
```
Hot take: The best habit tracker is the one that makes you feel guilty about breaking your streak.

Not in a toxic way. In a "I've built 30 days of momentum and I'm not throwing that away" way.

Visual accountability > willpower.

That's why I built LifeBlocks.
```

### Post 2
```
Your habits don't need a complex system.

They need:
- A simple way to track (yes/no/partial)
- Visual proof of progress (a grid)
- Fear of breaking the streak

That's it. Everything else is noise.
```

### Post 3
```
Showed my therapist my LifeBlocks grid.

Her: "Oh this is actually a great way to see patterns"

Me: "It's also why I can't skip the gym anymore"

The streak owns me now and I'm okay with that.
```

### Post 4
```
Apps I've paid for that I never use:
- Multiple gym apps
- Meditation subscriptions
- Productivity tools

Apps I actually open every day:
- LifeBlocks

The difference? 30 seconds to use. Visual proof I'm improving. Streak I can't break.

Simple wins.
