4. **Engagement (15%)** - Reply guy energy, threads, polls

**Reply Guy Strategy:**

"Day 1: I'm going to change my life
Day 2: I'm going to change my life

Day 7: I'm going to change my life

This is why we built LifeBlocks. Break the cycle. 🟩"
```

```
"Unpopular opinion: You don't need to wake up at 5am to be successful.

You need to do your habits consistently at whatever time works for YOU.

Stop copying morning routines. Start building YOUR routine."
```

```
"Your habits don't care what day it is.

Monday motivation? Tuesday grind? Wednesday wisdom?

Nah. Just show up. Every day. The grid doesn't lie. 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩"

```
"POV: You finally hit a 30-day streak

🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
